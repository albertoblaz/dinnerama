# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
backend/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
backend/.env*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
backend/log/*
backend/tmp/*

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
backend/tmp/pids/*

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
backend/storage/*
backend/tmp/storage/*

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
backend/config/master.key
